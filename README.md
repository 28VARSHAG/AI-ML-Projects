# AI-ML-Projects
This project was developed during my internship, focusing on applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to solve real-world problems. The work involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation. I explored algorithms such as classification, regression, and clustering, while also implementing deep learning models for better accuracy. The project aimed to enhance problem-solving using AI/ML approaches, with practical applications in data analysis, prediction, and automation.
